```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    # Create a dictionary to store the complement and index
    num_dict = {}
    
    # Iterate over the array
    for index, num in enumerate(nums):
        # Calculate the complement needed to reach the target
        complement = target - num
        
        # Check if complement is already in dictionary
        if complement in num_dict:
            # Return indices of the two numbers
            return [num_dict[complement], index]
        
        # Store the index of the current number
        num_dict[num] = index

# Example usage
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
result = two_sum(nums, target)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

Output:
```
[0, 1]
```
