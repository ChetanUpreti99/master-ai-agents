   - **Future Outlook:** The company can capitalize on trends like AI advancements to enhance interactivity.
   - **Investment Potential:** While Multiply has an innovative approach, the market's competitive nature and the need for technological advancements pose challenges.
   - **Reason for Non-Selection:** Despite its growth potential, Multiply operates in a highly competitive market where staying ahead with technological advancements is critical.
